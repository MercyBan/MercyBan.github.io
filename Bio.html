        I am Mercy Baning, originally from Ghana, West Africa but moved to New Jersey as a teen to be with my mother.

        Growing up all I wanted to be was in healthcare field since majority of my family were in that field. 
        
        After high school I went to college for Nursing but later realized it wasnâ€™t my passion. 
        
        I then got into customer services working as a customer service representative for United Airlines.
        
        As a CSR one of my roles was electronically checking passengers in and also rebooking passengers during irregular operations. 
        
        The system we used to rebook back then were so outdated it drove everyone crazy. 
        
        I always made jokes about going back to school to be a software developer to help create a better system to help agents to rebook faster, 
        
        print out vouchers for hotels and food just by a click of a button. 
        
        After some years there I decided to get into the corporate world and got a job at JPMorgan Chase as a fraud analyst and that role really 
        
        pushed me to get into the software developing field.
